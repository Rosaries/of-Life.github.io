  <b>The Introduction to the Rosary of Life</b><br>

  SIGN OF THE CROSS <br><br>
  <u><b>Renewal of Baptismal Vows on Behalf of Many</b></u><br>
  <i>I renounce the flesh, the world, and the devil that comes to steal, kill, and destroy the human body, soul, and spirit.</i>  
  <br><br>
  <u>The Apostles’ Creed</u><br>

  I believe in God, the Father almighty, Creator of heaven and earth, and in Jesus Christ, his only Son, our Lord, who was conceived by the Holy Spirit, born of the Virgin Mary, suffered under Pontius Pilate, was crucified, died and was buried; he descended into hell; on the third day he rose again from the dead; he ascended into heaven, and is seated at the right hand of God the Father almighty; from there he will come to judge the living and the dead.  I believe in the Holy Spirit, the Holy Catholic Church, the communion of saints, the forgiveness of sins, the resurrection of the body, and life everlasting.  Amen.
  <br><br>
  <u><b>To Our Father</b></u><br>
  <i>Lord Jesus, let us pray with you at the right hand of God our Father.  May fully live the prayer that you taught us and bring the Culture of Life to victory over the culture of death. 
  </i><br><br>

  Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name; thy kingdom come; thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven.  Give us this day our daily bread; and forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us; and lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.  Amen.
  <br><br>
  <u><b>To Our Mother</b></u><br>
  <i>Mother Mary, from the beginning to the end of life, pray for us to fully live the joyful, luminous, sorrowful, and glorious mysteries of your son.  May we all grow…
  …in love: that every family grow in God’s love and overcome the false love of the flesh.</i>
  <br><br>
  <u>Hail Mary</u><br>

  Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee.  Blessed are thou among women and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus.  Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners now, and at the hour of our death.  Amen.
  <br><br>
  <i>…in hope: that every community grow in God’s hope and overcome the false hope of the world. </i>
    Hail Mary…
  <br><br>
  <i>…in faith: that every society grow in their faith in God and overcome the lies and works of the devil.    </i>
  Hail Mary…
  <br><br>
  <u><b>Glory Be</b></u><br>
  <i>…in glory: that all of humanity overcome the enemy and together forever give God all the glory.</i>
  <br><br>

  Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit.  As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be, world without end.  Amen. 
  <br><hr><hr><br>
  AT THE END OF EACH MYSTERY <br>
  <u><b>The Fatima Prayer</b></u><br>

  Oh my Jesus, forgive us our sins.  Save us from the fires of hell.  Lead all souls to heaven, especially those in most need of thy mercy.  <br><br>
  <u><b>For a New Pentecost</b></u><br>
  <i><font size="-3">Marian Movement Prayer</font></i><br>

  Come, Holy Spirit!    Come by means of the powerful intercession of the Immaculate Heart of Mary, your well beloved spouse.  Amen. <br><br>

  O Glorious St. Joseph, like Jesus, I totally entrust myself to you.  As you formed your son to live the Gospel of Life, so fully form me in the image and likeness of the same Christ, our Lord.  Amen.  St. Joseph, increase our faith. 
  <br><br>

  <u><b>Fatima Pardon Prayers </b></u><br>
