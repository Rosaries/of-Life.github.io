            (Jn. 20:1-18). Lord of life, you turned your tomb into a temple. May
            we daily seek you and find you in our interior life of prayer. May
            we daily serve you in our exterior life of charity. May we daily
            renew our baptism of the Holy Spirit, trust in your Divine Mercy,
            and Marian Consecration of surrender to your Divine Will.

            (Mt. 26:20-25). Lord of life, we repent for lying and for living two
            lives. We repent for all the hypocrisy, scandals, corruption, and
            cover up in your Church. We pray that the abused, wounded members of
            your Body forgive and be healed. Save us from mortal sin and the
            fires of hell.

            (Acts 1:9-14). Lord of life, may the whole Church begin again in the
            upper room. May we reconcile with one another and become one heart,
            mind, and body in prayer. May we become one in your Divine Word,
            your Sacraments, works of mercy, and obedience to your apostles
            today.

            and lies that lead to schisms, heresies, and division in your Body.
            We repent for all the sacrileges, blasphemies, and outrages made
            against you. Forgive us for creating a “Christianity” without the
            Church.

              Hearing the many tongues of praise, the crowds ask, “What does

            (Acts 2). Lord of life, may the Holy Spirit confirm your Word with
            signs and wonders. May all Christians be one so that the world may
            believe, and we may lead many sinners to repentance and salvation.

            (Rv. 13). Lord of life, we repent for terrorism, communism, and
            masonry that seek to control humans, gain world power, and destroy
            the Church. May all Christians reunite and march together against
            the flesh, the world, and the devil.

            rationalizes sexual immorality, abortion, gender confusion, the
            slave trade, trans-human science, atheism, magic, witchcraft, and
            idolatry.
