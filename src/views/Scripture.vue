<b><u> SCRIPTURE STUDY TIPS </u> </b><br><br>

<b> Know Yourself
</b><br>
Know your spirit, soul, and body (1 Thessalonians 5:23, Matthew 26:38, 41, Romans 12:1-3). Be aware and be the master of your interior dialogue.  Your heart-spirit is asking, “What should I be doing?”  Your mind-soul is asking, “What do I plan on doing?”  Your body-flesh is asking, “What do I feel like doing?”  These three must become one like the Holy Trinity.  Our beliefs, thoughts, and feelings must do God’s Will. <br><br>

<b> Treasures
</b><br>
Search the Scriptures for heavenly treasures (Matthew 6:20-21; 7:7-11).  Meditate and ask God for the grace to put into practice these precious gems.  May we all fully put on the armor of God (Ephesians 6:10-19) and always do His Divine Will. <br><br>

<b><u> SCRIPTURE STUDY TIPS </u> </b><br><br>

Know his strategy to steal, kill and destroy (John 10:10).  Be aware of the world, the flesh, and the devil (Genesis 3:6, 1 John 2:16, Matthew 4:1-11; 13:18-23, Ephesians 2:1-3, James 3:15).

Even in your sleep be on guard (Matthew 2:13). <br><br>

Cut off and fully remove all deadly poison from your life (Mark 9:42-48, 2 Corinthians 6:14-7:1; 10:3-5).  On behalf of everyone, repent and fully renounce the enemy.  Be not afraid.
