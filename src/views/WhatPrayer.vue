<b> What is PRAYER? </b> <br>
<i>“Christian prayer is a covenant <u> relationship </u> between God and man in Christ.”  </i><br><br>
– Catechism #2564
<i> “In our weakness we do not know how to pray, but the Holy Spirit prays for us.” </i>–<font size=”-1”> Romans 8:26</font> <br><br>

<b><u> The Inner Room - Daily Prayer </u> </b> <br>
<font size=”-1”>Matthew 6:6 </font><br><br>

<u> Mind Prayer </u>– Pray with your mind: Meditate on the Word of God, the Mysteries of Christ’s Life, and the fullness of truth to <u> know </u> the will of God. <br><br>

<u> Heart Prayer </u>– Pray with your heart: Respond to the Lord’s beauty with awe and wonder, with holy fear and love.  Fully surrender and <u> obey </u> the will of God. <br><br>

<u> Body Prayer </u>– Pray with your whole body: Respond to the Lord’s goodness with your goodness.  Resolve to put into practice and fully <u> do </u> the will of God.  Amen! <br><br>

<u> Enlarge your Sphere of Influence </u><br>
Who are you praying for?  We gather everyone we know in your daily prayers like Noah who gathered all the living creatures into his ark to be saved from the flood.  With every Rosary bead, name each person in your sphere of influence.  Seek God’s mercy for them all.  Increase your intercessions and enlarge your circle of prayer.  Search and meditate on the following Scripture passages:  1 Chronicles 4:10, Exodus 34:24, Psalm 2:8, Isaiah 26:15; 54:2-3, Ezekiel 22:30-31. <br><br>

<b><u> The Upper Room - Rosary Cenacles </u> </b> <br>
<font size=”-1”> Matthew 18:19-20</font><br>
Form an intercessory team to pray together for the Culture of Life and against the culture of death. <br><br>

1.  Invite fellow Prayer Warriors to commit themselves to pray with you 5 times in a special place and time set apart for the Lord. <br><br>

2.  At each session include: Prayer, Share, and Care.  <br>
Prayer:  Pray the Rosary together <br>
with your whole heart, mind, and body. <br>
Share:  Share what each mystery means<br>
from a Scriptural perspective and <br>
how to fully live the Culture of Life. <br>
Care:  Pray for each other’s needs. <br><br>

3.  In the first session, pray the “INTRODUCTION” and the introduction of each of the four mysteries.  Then in the sessions that follow pray the Joyful, Luminous, Sorrowful, and Glorious Mysteries. <br><br>





<b> Choose wisely </b><br>
…for choose you must (Sir. 15:14-15).  You can choose your selfish will (the flesh), or other people’s will (the world), or the will of fallen angels (the devil).  You can also choose God’s will.  The flesh, the world, and the devil (Eph. 2:1-3) come to steal, kill, and destroy (Jn. 10:10).  The sins of the flesh steal our purity and ability to love.  The sins of the world kill our hope in heaven, and the devil destroys our faith in God.  But  <i>“those who do the will of God will live forever” ( </i>
1 Jn. 2:17). <br><br>

<b><u> A History of the Rosary </u> </b><br>
In 1208, the Blessed Mother of Jesus gifted St. Dominic and the Church with the gift of “her psalter,” the Holy Rosary.  Meditating on the birth, life, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ, the Church has continually gathered together and prayed the Rosary.  By means of campaigns, confraternities, and spiritual crusades, our Lady and Lord have defeated: <br>
- heresies (e.g., the Albigensians), <br>
- Muslim invasions (e.g., the Battle of Lepanto), <br>
- pagan cities (e.g., Pompei in the late 1800’s), <br>
- communist regimes (e.g., Austria in the 1955, Brazil in 1964), <br>
- dictatorships (e.g., the Philippines in 1986), and <br>
- Muslim terrorists (e.g., Nigeria in 2017). <br><br>

<u> The Rosary of Life Dream </u><br>
I want to thank the Culture of Life Team and the faithful warriors that have gathered with me to learn and pray.  What is the Lord’s battle plan to overcome the culture of death with the Culture of Life?  What are God’s dreams that we must dream?  What is God’s will that we must obey?  <br><br>

We pray for more souls to fully form their consciences, examine their lives, repent, reject the culture of death, learn to live in God’s grace, and build up his Culture of Life.  We pray that the Rosary of Life grows in more: <br><br>

	1. Inner Rooms of private and family prayer<br>
	2. Upper Rooms of church cenacles and crusades<br>
	3. Marches on the secular streets of society<br><br>

We pray for a New Pentecost with signs, wonders, and powerful testimonies that confirm the beauty, goodness, and truth of the Gospel of Life.  We pray that the Rosary of Life will become a movement of the Holy Spirit that fills the Church with his glory and renews the face of the earth.  May God’s name be hallowed.  May His Kingdom come, and His will be done on earth as it is in heaven.  Amen! <br><br>





<b> With every Choice, there is a Consequence </b><br><img src =Trees.jpg width="300" ><br>
 

<i> “God has placed before you fire and water.  Stretch out your hand for whichever you choose.  Before each person are life and death, and whichever one chooses will be given” </i> (Sir. 15:16-17). <br><br>

<b> The Tree of Life is the Holy Cross and Sword </b><br>
<i> The Lord says,
“I have come to bring a sword of division.” - Mt. 10:34
“Take the sword of the Spirit, the Word of God” - Eph.6:17
</i><br><br>

Beautiful - Good - Truth - Life - Heaven<br> <img src =Sword.jpg width="300" ><br>
 
Ugly - Evil	Lies - Death - Hell<br><br>

<i> “Overcome evil with good”</i> – Rm. 12:21

<b> “The Battle belongs to the Lord”</b> <br>
<i> “Blessed be the Lord, my Rock, who trains my hands for war and my fingers for battle” </i><br>– Psalm 144:1<br>

“Put your finger and see my hands, and bring your hand and put it in my side.  Do not be unbelieving but believe… Who is the victor that conquers the world?  The one who believes.”  (Jn. 20;27, 1 Jn. 5:5)
