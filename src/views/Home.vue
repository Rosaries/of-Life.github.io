  <i>For the Triumph of the Immaculate Heart of Mary</i> <br><br>

Together let us pray in the upper room 
for families, communities, society, 
and all of humanity
to overcome division with divine vision, 
ugliness with beauty, evil with good, 
lies with truth, and the culture of death with the Culture of Life. <br> <br>

<u> John Paul II ( The Gospel of Life #95 ) </u><br>

In our present social context, marked by a dramatic struggle between the ‘culture of life’ and the ‘culture of death’, there is need to develop a deep critical sense, capable of discerning true values and authentic needs.  What is urgently called for is a general mobilization of consciences and a united ethical effort to activate a great campaign in support of life. All together, we must build a new culture of life.

<i>“I call heaven and earth today to witness against you:  I have set before you life and death, the blessing and the curse.  Choose life, then, that you and your descendants may live.” </i>
<br> - Deuteronomy 30:19
