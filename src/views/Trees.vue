      <b>THE TREE OF LIFE</b>
      <br /><br />
      <i>Whoever eats from the tree of life will live forever – Genesis 3:22</i>
      <br /><br />
      In the Rosary of Life, we pray together in agreement that God may build up
      his Culture of Life on earth as it is in heaven (Mt. 18:19). We pray for
      the grace to live all the Mysteries of Jesus Christ, who is
      <i>“our daily Bread”</i>. We pray for every family, community, society,
      and all of humanity. We cultivate the soil and plant the Joyful roots. We
      prune the Luminous trunk. We graft on the Sorrowful branches. We harvest
      the Glorious fruits of eternal life. We trust God will give the growth (1
      Cor. 3:7). <br /><br />

      <b>THE TREE OF DEATH</b>
      <br /><br />
      <i
        >Whoever eats from the tree of knowledge of good and evil will surely
        die. – Genesis 2:17</i
      ><br /><br />

      In the Rosary of Life, we stand in the gap (Ez. 22:30-31). On behalf of
      all people, we repent, forgive, and pray for mercy, healing and
      deliverance. In Jesus’ name we totally reject all the vices, lies, and
      social sins of the culture of death. With Jesus we pray,
      <i
        >“Forgive us as we forgive; lead us not into temptation, but deliver us
        from evil.”</i
      >
      With the sword of the Rosary, we uproot the sins of the flesh. We cut down
      the trunk of the sinful world. We burn the branches of the devil. We fully
      put to the death the fruits of death. (Mt. 3:10) <br /><br />




      <b>THE GLORIOUS MYSTERIES</b>
      <br />
      The fruits of the Tree of Life represent the Lord’s resurrection. We pray
      that all of humanity become one, glorified image and likeness of the Most
      Holy Trinity. May we all triumph in the Immaculate Heart of Mary.
      <i>“Thine is the Kingdom, the power, and the glory forever.”</i>
      <br /><br />

      <b>The Fruits of Death</b><br />
      On behalf of humanity, we pray to fully obey the Lord’s battle plans and
      victory over the flesh, the world, and the devil. We renounce abortion,
      suicide, murder, and all the evil fruits of the tree of death. May Jesus
      Christ save us all from spiritual death and the fires of hell.
      <br /><br />

      <b>THE SORROWFUL MYSTERIES</b>
      <br />
      The branches of the Tree of Life represent the Lord’s passion and death on
      the cross. We pray that societies grow in a firm faith, humility and
      obedience to God. <i>“Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven.”</i>
      <br /><br />

      <b>The Branches of the Devil</b><br />

      On behalf of society, we pray for mercy, healing and deliverance from the
      devil. We reject all the lies and temptations of the communist revolution
      and the cancel culture of pride, idolatry, rage, and dictatorship.
      <br /><br />


      <b>THE LUMINOUS MYSTERIES</b>
      <br />
      The trunk of the tree of life represents the public ministry of Jesus. We
      pray that communities may grow in the true hope that God’s promises will
      be fulfilled in their midst. <i> “Thy Kingdom come.”</i> <br /><br />

            <b>The Trunk of the World</b><br />

      On behalf of communities, we pray for mercy, healing, and deliverance from
      all the sins of the fallen world. We reject all the lies and temptations
      of the industrial revolution and the throw away culture of false hopes,
      greed for more money, addictions, and depression.
      <br /><br />

      <b>THE JOYFUL MYSTERIES</b>
      <br />

      The deep roots of the Tree of Life represent the hidden life of the Holy
      Family. We pray that families may grow in authentic love. May their
      bodies, as temples of the Holy Spirit, glorify God.
      <i>“Hallowed by thy name.”</i> <br /><br />

      <b>The Roots of the Flesh</b><br />

      On behalf of all families, we pray for mercy, healing, and deliverance
      from all the sins of the flesh. We reject all the lies and temptations of
      the sexual revolution and the hook up culture of lust, perversion, and
      fake love.
