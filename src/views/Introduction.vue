        >Where is our hope? What is God’s vision?<br />
        Ten points of why the Rosary for Life is so needed today <br /><br
      /></i>

      1. THE LENS OF LIES <br /><i>“You call good evil and evil good”</i> (Isa.
      5:20).<br />
      Deeply wounded, we can easily perceive reality through the lens of half
      truths and false beliefs.
      <br /><br />
      2. THE LENS OF SCRIPTURE <br />
      <i>“If you keep My Word, you will know the truth”</i> (Jn. 8:31-32).<br />
      We must perceive reality through the lens of Jesus, who separates truth
      from lies and good from evil. The Way, Truth, and Life invites us to
      heaven, warns us of hell, and gives us the power to choose. <br /><br />
      3. SOCIAL SINS and THE GOSPEL OF LIFE<br /><i>“Let my people go”</i> (Ex.
      5:1).<br />
      St. John Paul II highlights the great clash between the “culture of death”
      and the “culture of life.” We must mobilize peoples’ conscience, join a
      united ethical campaign, and build up a new culture of life. <br /><br />
      4. THE ROSARY CRUSADES<br /><i>“Pray always”</i> (1 Thess. 5:17).<br />
      The Rosary is the weapon that has defeated many heresies, invasions, and
      enemies of the Church. <br /><br /><i></i> 5. ROSARY OF IDENTITY<br />
      <i>“You are my beloved” </i>(Mk. 1:11).<br />
      We must form our conscience and live our baptismal vows. We must fully
      repent and renounce the culture of death, and we must fully believe,
      proclaim, and live the Lord’s gospel of life. <br /><br />
      6. ROSARY OF UNITY<br /><i>“Father, may they be one” </i>(Jn. 17:21).<br />
      We must persevere through the narrow gate of loving sinners and hating
      sin. Let us strive to reconcile truth with love, justice with mercy,
      doctrine with pastoral care, and human dignity with social justice. <br />
      <br />
      7. ROSARY OF HEALING<br /><i>“By your faith, you are healed”</i> (Mt.
      9:22).<br />
      Exposing social sins can provoke many emotions. May truth and mercy heal
      us and set us free to love and to forgive everyone.
      <br /><br />
      8. ROSARY OF INTERCESSION<br /><i>“Father, forgive them”</i> (Lk.
      23:34).<br />
      As a priestly people, we are to pray to God for our Pope, the Church, and
      the whole world. <br /><br />
      9. ROSARY OF HOLINESS<br /><i>“Be holy” </i>(1 Thess. 5:23).<br />
      The desires, thoughts, and actions of our heart, mind, and body must obey
      God’s will. We must motivate, educate, and activate our Lady’s army.
      <br /><br />
      10. THE ROSARY MYSTERIES<br /><i>“Come and follow me”</i> (Mk. 10:21).<br />
      Through the birth, life, death, and resurrection of Jesus, let us pray for
      the Culture of Life and renounce the culture of death. Let us fully live
      the mysteries of Christ. <br /><br />
