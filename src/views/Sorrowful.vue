              distress. The spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak”

            (Mt. 26:36-46). Lord of faith, may all the arts lead us to your
            awesome beauty, goodness, and truth. By our daily consecration,
            intercession and penance, may we persevere through all the dark
            nights of the spirit, soul, and senses. May we faithfully accept,
            know, and do the will of God.

            indulging ourselves with immoral shows, videos, parties, and
            mischief. Forgive us for wasting excessive time and getting too
            comfortable with the sleepy culture of entertainment.
